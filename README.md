# Campus-Network-Packet-Tracer
Simulation of Campus nework in Cisco Packet Tracer

The Campus includes the following networks:
•	Principal
•	Office 
•	Staff – Teachers
•	Laboratory
•	Library
Dynamic Routing Protocol and Access List Security is implemented. 
Routing Protocol
The network needs to be dynamically routed and traffic needs to be regulated, hence we intent to use EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).
